# Tutorial

This tutorial covers many of the more straightforward uses of Radian.
Each of the three sections works towards producing increasingly
complex plots, with a number of sections describing the features of
Radian that we're going to use (often with some scattered exercises
for you to look at), wrapped up by a "Putting it together" section
where you will be guided through constructing a plot using a number of
Radian's features.

Radian is very much an open-ended tool, and what you can do with it is
really limited only by your imagination.  We'll cover only a small
fraction of what you can do in this tutorial, but it should be enough
to get you started.

## [1. Function plots](1-function-plots)

Uses simple function-based plots to introduce Radian: covers plot
setup, line plots, Radian expressions and basic plot styling.

###### [1.1. Plot setup](1-function-plots/1-1-plot-setup.html)
###### [1.2. Line plots](1-function-plots/1-2-line-plots.html)
###### [1.3. Radian expressions](1-function-plots/1-3-radian-expressions.html)
###### [1.4. Basic interaction](1-function-plots/1-4-basic-interaction.html)
###### [1.5. Putting it together](1-function-plots/1-5-putting-it-together.html)

## [2. Data plots](2-data-plots)

Plots using data: covers data access, scatter plots, bar charts and
histograms, more complex Radian expressions and plot layout.

###### [2.1. Accessing plot data](2-data-plots/2-1-accessing-plot-data.html)
###### [2.2. Scatter plots](2-data-plots/2-2-scatter-plots.html)
###### [2.3. Bar charts](2-data-plots/2-3-bar-charts.html)
###### [2.4. Plot layout](2-data-plots/2-4-plot-layout.html)
###### [2.5. Putting it together](2-data-plots/2-5-putting-it-together.html)

## [3. Interactive plots](3-interactive-plots)

Interactivity using Angular: builds a simple data viewer for some
historical financial data.

###### [3.1. Angular data binding](3-interactive-plots/3-1-data-binding.html)
###### [3.2. Building the example](3-interactive-plots/3-2-building-the-example.html)
