<h3>Functions with palettes</h3>

<p>Palettes can be applied to function plots as easily as to data
  plots.  Here we see an example where the stroke colour is varied
  along the plotted curves.  Radian attempts to break such curves into
  a relatively small number of segments for stroking to keep things
  efficient.</p>
<palette name="bgr">
  0 blue; 0.5 grey; 1 red
</palette>

<palette name="gyo">
  0 green; 0.5 yellow; 1 orange
</palette>

<plot height=300 aspect=3 stroke-width=2 x="[[seq(0,4*PI,101)]]"
      axis-x-label="Time" axis-y-label="sin(x) / cos(x)">
  <lines y="[[sin(x)]]" stroke="[[bgr(y)]]"/>
  <lines y="[[cos(x)]]" stroke="[[gyo(y)]]"/>
</plot>
